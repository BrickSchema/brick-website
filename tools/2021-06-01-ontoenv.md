# OntoEnv

OntoEnv is a simple tool for managing a collection of ontology definitions (instances of `owl:Ontology`) and dependencies (`owl:imports` statements). This is functionality that is often provided by modeling IDEs such as [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) and [TopBraid Composer](https://www.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-composer/), but seems currently lacking in the Python/RDFlib ecosystem. Once initialized in a directory, OntoEnv will search for all RDF files and resolve their `owl:imports` statements, downloading remote files or resolving from local definitions as needed.

OntoEnv provides Python bindings which will import the ontology definitions for all `owl:imports` statements into an `rdflib.Graph`.

## Typical Usage

Typical usage looks as follows.

First, tell OntoEnv to figure out the dependency graph and cache the ontology/graph definitions.

```bash
$ ontoenv init # resolving imports can take a few seconds, depending on the number of dependencies
$ ontoenv refresh # run 'refresh' if any dependencies change
```

Then, use the Python bindings to import ontology definitions into a graph

```python
import rdflib
import ontoenv

# initialize environment
env = ontoenv.OntoEnv()

g = rdflib.Graph()
g.parse("my_graph.ttl", format="ttl")
env.import_dependencies(g)
```

Other commands:
- `dump`: print the locations of all URIs known by `ontoenv`

## Installation

```
pip install ontoenv
```

## Details

An RDF graph can be associated with a URI by including a statement in the graph that the URI is an instance of `owl:Ontology`.

```ttl
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

<http://example.com/my/graph> a owl:Ontology .
# ... other triples
```

Other RDF graphs can import the contents of `http://example.com/my/graph` in their own `owl:Ontology` definitions:

```ttl
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

<http://corporation.inc/my/other/graph> a owl:Ontology ;
    owl:imports <http://example.com/my/graph> .
```

OntoEnv has the option of transitively resolving these dependencies.
