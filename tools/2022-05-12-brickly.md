## Introduction
Brickly is a site for building SPARQL queries with Brick. This tool is intended to allow those unfamiliar with SPARQL syntax to make queries against Brick defined buildings. Brickly uses Google's Blockly API in order to allow for simple, block-based programming in a custom SPARQL manner.

There are three custom types of blocks:
 - **triple** blocks are the heart of querying. They represent a [RDF triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/#section-triple) which has a `subject`, `predicate`, and `object`. Though the triple block reads top down, each dropdown corresponds left to right as subject -> predicate -> object.
 - **let** blocks allow for variable creation. Given a `variableName` and a `type` selected in a dropdown, a line of the form will be created upon querying: `?variableName rdf:type <type> .`
 - **limit** blocks limit the resultant amount of data queried.

## Installation
In order to run a Brickly instance, you can easily use our `Dockerfile` after cloning:

    cd brickly
    docker build -t brickly .
    docker run -dp 5000:5000 --rm -v `pwd`:/opt brickly bldg.ttl

Note that on Windows, `%cd%` must be used instead of ``pwd``.

    docker run -dp 5000:5000 --rm -v %cd%:/opt brickly bldg.ttl

Note that any valid turtle (.ttl) file can be used to query against instead of the example `bldg.ttl`.

## Instructions
An example demo video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/cSFBMrzIK1s). Detailed instructions can be found below.

Create three "let" blocks, named "sensor" "device" and "zone" respectively. Sensor should be a `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor`, device should be a `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#VAV` and zone should be a `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#HVAC_Zone`.

Next, create a new "triple" block. 
 - Select `?device` in the upper dropdown. 
 - Select `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#hasPoint` in the middle dropdown. 
 - Select `?sensor` in the lower dropdown.

Create another "triple" block. 
 - Select `?device` in the upper dropdown. 
 - Select `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#feeds` in the middle dropdown. 
 - Select `?zone` in the lower dropdown.

Click the arrow icon in the top right of the "Run Query" container to run the query against an example building file.

The generated code (as a result of the block query) should look like:

```sql
SELECT * WHERE {
    ?sensor rdf:type <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor> .
    ?device rdf:type <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#VAV> .
    ?zone rdf:type <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#HVAC_Zone> .
    ?device <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#hasPoint> ?sensor .
    ?device <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#feeds> ?zone .
}
```
