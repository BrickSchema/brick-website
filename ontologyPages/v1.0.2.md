### Classes

- The Brick class namespace is `https://brickschema.org/schema/1.0.2/Brick#`
- Classes belong to `owl:Class` and are arranged into a hierarchy with `rdfs:subClassOf`
- Equivalent classes (the members of the classes are the same) are related with the `owl:equivalentClass` property
- Definitions given with `skos:definition`
- Fixes some inconsistencies/bugs in the ontology

### Relationships

(Relationships are the Brick term for owl ObjectProperties between instances of classes)

Domains and ranges are defined in terms of classes. Stating that the `rdfs:range` of a relationship
is of class `brick:Equipment` means that the object of the relationship should be an instance of the
`brick:Equipment` class.
