### Classes

- The Brick class namespace is `https://brickschema.org/schema/1.0.3/Brick#`
- Classes belong to `owl:Class` and are arranged into a hierarchy with `rdfs:subClassOf`
- Equivalent classes (the members of the classes are the same) are related with the `owl:equivalentClass` property
- Definitions given with `skos:definition`
- We are eliminating equipment-flavored classes where it makes sense
    - e.g. `brick:AHU_Average_Exhaust_Air_Static_Pressure_Sensor` is just a `Average_Exhaust_Air_Static_Pressure_Sensor` that is a point of an AHU.
- Classes are equivalent to a set of tags.

### Relationships

(Relationships are the Brick term for owl ObjectProperties between instances of classes)

At the surface level, relationship work the same as they did in the original Brick.
All the same relationships still exist (where I remembered to define them), and they have their
inverses defined using `owl:inverseOf`.

Domains and ranges are defined in terms of classes. Stating that the `rdfs:range` of a relationship
is of class `brick:Equipment` means that the object of the relationship should be an instance of the
`brick:Equipment` class.
