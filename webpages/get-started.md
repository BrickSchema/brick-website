## Brick Tutorials

Several tutorials have been developed for Brick and its related tools.

**[BuildSys 2017 Tutorial Slides][2]**: The Brick team presented a tutorial at the [2017 BuildSys conference][9]; the tutorial presented a high-level overview of the Brick schema, how to create a Brick model from existing building data and metadata, and the development of a simple building analytics application. The code produced during the tutorial has been captured in a set of [Jupyter Notebooks][3].

**[Mortar Tutorial][8]**: Mortar is a free, open testbed of building data and Brick models that faciliate the development of reproducible building analytics. The Mortar Tutorial presents an interactive overview of the platform and walks the user through the implementation of a fault detection application.

**[ACM E-Energy 2019 Tutorial Slides][10]**: The Brick team presented a tutorial at the [2019 ACM E-Energy conference][11]; the tutorial presented an overview of the Brick schema, the Mortar data platform, and how Brick and Mortar can be used together to author generalizable building analytics applications.
