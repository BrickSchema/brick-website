We are pleased to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Brick and VBIS to collaborate and integrate the developments. 

Both initiatives have the aligned goal of promoting a consistent standardized approach to structuring data to gain better insights but with differing focus areas. Brick, through collaboration with Project Haystack and ASHRAE, defines an extensive dictionary of I/O points (including automation control points), HVAC, lighting and electrical assets, and relationships between assets and points. VBIS in turn has a comprehensive classification structure and asset specific metatag for all assets that make up the built environment as well as a mechanism to allow linking asset data that is stored in disparate locations to allow discovery and use of information. 

The collaboration brings together these complementary developments. The VBIS classification structure, which captures detailed asset properties not covered by Brick, will be mapped to the asset classes in Brick. This will provide a comprehensive data model definition that supports deploying analytics, energy efficiency measures, automation as well as Asset Management and Facility Management activities such as lifecycle planning, maintenance planning and performance benchmarking.

We look forward to keeping you posted on the upcoming milestones.
