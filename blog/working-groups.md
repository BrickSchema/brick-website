As part of the [Brick Consortium](/consortium), a set of working groups have been established to organize community contributions and feedback around different aspects of the Brick ontology.
There are two meetings of each working group: one in the morning (Pacific) and one in the evening (Pacific) so that there is a reasonable time to join for most parts of the world. We aim to cover the same agenda for the group at each meeting, so there is only need to attend one of the two, so please pick the meeting that is most comfortable for your time zone.

The three working groups are:

- **Ontology Development Working Group**: this working group discusses additions, extensions and fixes to the Brick ontology definition. This includes, but is not limited to, new classes, modeling domains, changes to the ontology structure, and documentation for Brick.
    - Every second Wednesday, from 6:00 - 7:00 PM, Pacific Time on [Zoom](https://mines.zoom.us/j/96983354945?pwd=cGJ5OWpTRnplandlOFQyd2tKWXB1UT09)
